      <p class="doc-updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Pick a topic. Get one prompt per day for 28 days. Write your thoughts in your browser. Your words never leave your device. Download whenever you want.</p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>

      <h3>Choose a Topic</h3>
      <p>You pick the theme for your 28 days: self-improvement, creativity, relationships, work, health, or something custom. The notebook generates one prompt per day based on your topic.</p>

      <h3>Daily Prompts</h3>
      <p>Every day you visit, you get a new prompt. Something thoughtful. Something that makes you think. Not spam. Not generic. Real questions designed to help you explore your chosen topic.</p>

      <h3>Write in Your Browser</h3>
      <p>Type directly in the notebook. Your entries are saved automatically to your browser's localStorage. No servers. No cloud. No harvesting your thoughts.</p>

      <h3>Download Anytime</h3>
      <p>When you're done with your 28 days, download all your entries as a text file. Back it up. Keep it. Share it if you want. It's yours.</p>

      <h2>Storage & Privacy</h2>

      <h3>Where Are Your Entries Stored?</h3>
      <p>In your browser's localStorage. Not on our servers. Not in a database we have access to. If you clear your browser data, they're gone. If you keep them, only you can see them.</p>

      <h3>We Don't Have Access</h3>
      <p>We literally cannot read your notebook entries. They don't sync to our servers. We don't log them. We don't analyze them. Your private thoughts stay private.</p>

      <h3>Browser to Browser</h3>
      <p>If you use different browsers or devices, your entries won't sync. They're tied to that specific browser. That's privacy, not a feature. Don't expect them to follow you to your phone.</p>

      <h3>Back Up Your Entries</h3>
      <p>Download regularly. Don't rely on localStorage alone. If you reinstall your OS or clear your cache, they'll be gone. The download button is there for a reason.</p>

      <h2>Physical Notebooks</h2>

      <h3>Printed Copies</h3>
      <p>If you complete a 28-day notebook, you can bring it to a Death2Data event and get it printed on-site. Custom covers. Collectible editions.</p>

      <h3>D2D Events</h3>
      <p>Look for sanctioned Death2Data events: CRINGE, SOUL, DEAL, ULTRA, NIL. Each event creates its own unique covers. Attend, bring your completed notebook, get it printed for free.</p>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>Events typically have a printing station. You bring your notebook (or bring the downloaded file on your phone). The team prints it right there. You leave with a collectible printed copy.</p>

      <h2>Technical Details</h2>

      <h3>Built With</h3>
      <p>Vanilla JavaScript. localStorage API for persistence. No frameworks. No database backend. Just client-side storage that respects your privacy.</p>

      <h3>Data Structure</h3>
      <p>Each notebook entry is a JSON object stored in your browser. Topic, date, prompt, your response. Simple. Auditable.</p>

      <h3>Export Format</h3>
      <p>Downloads as plain text. Each entry timestamped. Readable forever. No proprietary format. No vendor lock-in.</p>

      <h2>Under the Hood</h2>

      <h3>What We Built</h3>
      <p>Prompt generation engine. localStorage management. Download functionality. Simple daily UI.</p>

      <h3>What We Use</h3>
      <p>Browser APIs only. No external libraries. No CDNs. No tracking.</p>

      <h3>Influences</h3>
      <p>We were inspired by the morning pages practice (Julia Cameron's stream-of-consciousness writing), journaling apps like Day One, and bullet journaling culture. But we kept it privacy-first: your words stay on your device, not synced to corporate servers or analyzed for marketing insights.</p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <p>localStorage has a limit (usually 5-10MB). One notebook probably won't hit that. But if you're writing novels, you might run out. Delete old notebooks if needed.</p>
