      <h1>Billing</h1>
      <p class="doc-updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

      <h2>Pricing</h2>
      <p>$1 every 28 days. That's the whole price. No hidden fees. No upsells. No "introductory rates" that jump up later. $1. Every month.</p>

      <h2>Billing Cycle</h2>

      <h3>28-Day Billing</h3>
      <p>We bill every 28 days, not calendar months. This gives consistent billing dates and avoids month-length confusion.</p>

      <h3>First Charge</h3>
      <p>When you sign up, the first $1 charges immediately. Your membership becomes active right away.</p>

      <h3>Recurring Charges</h3>
      <p>$1 charges every 28 days after your signup date unless you cancel.</p>

      <h3>Your Billing Date</h3>
      <p>Check the Stripe billing portal to see your exact billing date. You can set up calendar reminders if you want to track it.</p>

      <h2>Payment Methods</h2>

      <h3>What We Accept</h3>
      <p>All major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover). Apple Pay. Google Pay. Anything Stripe accepts.</p>

      <h3>Who Processes It</h3>
      <p>Stripe handles all payments. They're PCI-DSS compliant. We never see your card number. Stripe stores your payment method. We never access it.</p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>Your card is encrypted. Stripe is a trusted payment processor used by millions of businesses. Your payment info is safer there than on most websites.</p>

      <h2>Managing Your Subscription</h2>

      <h3>Access the Billing Portal</h3>
      <p>Go to <a href="/admin/manage.html">/admin/manage.html</a>. Enter your email. Click "Open Billing Portal". You're taken directly to Stripe.</p>

      <h3>Update Payment Method</h3>
      <p>In the Stripe portal, click "Manage payment methods". Add a new card or update your existing one. Takes 30 seconds.</p>

      <h3>View Invoices</h3>
      <p>Stripe keeps a record of every charge. Download invoices anytime. Keep them for your records.</p>

      <h3>See Your Next Billing Date</h3>
      <p>The portal shows when your next charge will happen. No surprises.</p>

      <h2>Cancellation</h2>

      <h3>How to Cancel</h3>
      <p>Go to <a href="/admin/manage.html">/admin/manage.html</a> → enter your email → "Open Billing Portal" → click "Cancel subscription". Done.</p>

      <h3>When Does It Take Effect?</h3>
      <p>Cancellation is immediate. You keep access until your current billing period ends. After that, your membership expires.</p>

      <h3>No Questions Asked</h3>
      <p>We don't email asking why. We don't nag you. We don't offer discounts to keep you. You decided to leave, so you leave.</p>

      <h3>Reactivation</h3>
      <p>If you cancel and change your mind, you can sign up again. You'll be treated like a new member. Paid plans don't have "pause" features - you either subscribe or you don't.</p>

      <h2>Refunds & Disputes</h2>

      <h3>No Refunds</h3>
      <p>It's $1. We'd spend more processing a refund than the refund itself. But you can cancel immediately and stop charges.</p>

      <h3>What If You Cancel Mid-Cycle?</h3>
      <p>You keep access until your billing period ends. We don't prorate refunds. If you paid for 28 days, you get 28 days even if you cancel on day 3.</p>

      <h3>Chargebacks</h3>
      <p>If you dispute the charge with your card company instead of canceling, we'll lose the payment plus chargeback fees. That hurts us more than a simple cancellation. Just cancel if you want to stop paying.</p>

      <h2>Data & Privacy</h2>

      <h3>What We Store</h3>
      <p>Your email address. Your subscription status (active/canceled). Your signup date. That's it.</p>

      <h3>What Stripe Stores</h3>
      <p>Your payment method. Your billing address. Your card details. Your invoice history. Stripe's privacy policy covers that.</p>

      <h3>We Never See Your Card</h3>
      <p>Your card number never hits our servers. Stripe tokenizes it and gives us a token. We charge the token, not the card directly.</p>

      <h3>Email Marketing?</h3>
      <p>We email about billing events only: signup confirmation, failed payment, cancellation. We don't do marketing emails or newsletters. Your email is for transactional use only.</p>

      <h2>Billing Issues</h2>

      <h3>Card Declined?</h3>
      <p>Stripe will retry failed charges. If it keeps failing, Stripe will email you. Update your payment method in the portal. We can't manually retry charges - Stripe controls that.</p>

      <h3>Wrong Amount Charged?</h3>
      <p>It should always be $1 every 28 days. If you see something different, email <a href="mailto:matt@death2data.com">matt@death2data.com</a> immediately with the charge amount and date.</p>

      <h3>Can't Access Stripe Portal?</h3>
      <p>Make sure you're entering the exact email you signed up with. If you're still stuck, email us with the email address on your account and we can help troubleshoot.</p>

      <h3>Other Issues?</h3>
      <p>Email <a href="mailto:matt@death2data.com">matt@death2data.com</a> with details. Include the amount charged, the date, your email, and what's wrong. We'll help.</p>

      <h2>Taxes</h2>
      <p>If your jurisdiction requires sales tax, it's included in the $1. We handle it. You pay $1, we collect tax if applicable, Stripe remits it. No surprises.</p>

      <h2>Still have questions?</h2>
      <p>Email <a href="mailto:matt@death2data.com">matt@death2data.com</a> - I read everything and respond personally.</p>
